<h1> Project 002: Boolean based Sql Injection </h1>

Well it's not really a project but I thought it'd be a short scripting practice for today. 

<h4> Summary </h4>
This basically exploits a blind-sql injection in DVWA (Damn vulnerable Web App) and wrote it as a proof-of-concept to dump the database name.
